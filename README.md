# DailyCodingProblem

Below are JavaScript written. One problem at minimum, a day. This Repository will contain answers, documentation and thoughts/methodology. 

Some solutions may contain their own visualization page for generalized solutions and implementation.

## Problem #1:
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

**Solution:**


## Problem #2:
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For Example: given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10+ 7 is 17.

**Solution:**
